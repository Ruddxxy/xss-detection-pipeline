# XSS Attack Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a **hybrid ML pipeline** to detect **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.  
The approach combines **AST-based structural features** and **TF-IDF lexical features** with a hybrid model:
- **Isolation Forest** ‚Üí anomaly detection (flags unknown/novel payloads)
- **Random Forest** ‚Üí supervised classification (predicts malicious vs benign)

---

## üöÄ Features
- Extracts **AST-based features** using `esprima` (function calls, DOM access, event handlers).
- Computes **entropy & token statistics** to detect obfuscation.
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for lexical analysis.
- Hybrid ML pipeline catches both **known and obfuscated payloads**.
- Evaluation includes:
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1)
  - Confusion matrix heatmap
  - Top feature importance chart

---

## üìä Results
- **Precision:** ~98%  
- **Recall (malicious class):** ~98%  
- **F1-score:** ~98%  
- Robust against several obfuscation tricks.
- Reduced **false positives by 35%** compared to baseline models.  

Visualization examples included in the notebook:
- Confusion Matrix  
- Top-10 Feature Importances
